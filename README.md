First Website learning HTML5/CSS3
This is just a simple Website in order to exercise semantic HTML5 and CSS Flexbox.
I struggled with the Navigation Bar. I needed to understand and make the decision to use semantic HTML instead of divs and where to allocate the tag <nav>. After I understood that <nav> can be allocated in the <header> was easer to proceed with the styling, which is very minimalist for me, but it's just a exercise.
